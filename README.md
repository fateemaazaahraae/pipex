<h1><strong>‚úèÔ∏è Pipex : </strong></h1>
<p><i>Pipex is a project that re-creates in C the way two commands are piped together via | in the shell </i><p><br>
<h1>üí° About the project : </h1>
<p>This project will let you discover in detail a UNIX mechanism that you already know
by using it in your program.</p> <br><br>

<h1>üíØ Final Grade : </h1> <br>


<h1>Description of mandatory part :</h1>
<p>Your program will be executed as follows:</p>
<p>./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2</p>
<p>It must take 4 arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>file1 and file2 are file names.</li>
  <li>cmd1 and cmd2 are shell commands with their parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>It must behave exactly the same as the shell command below:</p>
<p>< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2</p><br>
<h1>Description of bonus part :</h1>
<p>You will get extra points if you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Handle multiple pipes :<strong><i>(15 points)</i></strong></p>
  <p>This :</p>
  <pre>    $> ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 ... cmdn file2</pre>
  <p>Should behave like this :</p>
  <pre>    $> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 ... | cmdn > file2</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support ¬´ and ¬ª when the first parameter is "here_doc" :<strong><i>(10 points)</i></strong></p>
    <p>This :</p>
    <pre>    $> ./pipex here_doc LIMITER cmd cmd1 file</pre>
    <p>Should behave like this :</p>
    <pre>    $> cmd1 << LIMITER | cmd2 >> file</pre>
  </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h1>Fork : </h1>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>What is Fork ?</h3>
    <p>`fork()` is a system call in C programming that creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. After fork() is called, we have two processes : the parent process and the child process. The child process is a duplicate of the parent process. The child process inherits the memory space, file descriptors, and other attributes of the parent process with its own unique process ID (PID). Both processes continue executing from the point where fork() was called, but they have different return values from fork(): the parent receives the PID of the child process, while the child receives a return value of 0 or negative value (usually -1) means the creation of the child process was unsuccessful ‚ùå.</p>
